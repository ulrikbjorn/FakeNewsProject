# Fake News project

The goal of this project is to create a fake news prediction system. Fake news is a major problem that can have serious negative effects on how people understand the world around them. You will work with a dataset containing real and fake news in order to train a simple and a more advanced classifier to solve this problem. This project covers the full Data Science pipeline, from data processing, to modelling, to visualization and interpretation.

The Jupyter Notebook relies on a few non-standard Python packages which can be acquired using 'pip install'.  

As the datasets involved are quite large, longer running times should be expected.

The files are available at: https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus/releases/tag/v1.0 
and you will need an unarchiver to decompress them.
